# Code-Wrk
Just some coding work I made
The MinorProject.m file is a Project I made that connects to an arduino board along with a moisture sensor and pump I wired into a MOSFET. 
When the code runs, the code sends a signal to the moisture sensor and with the parameters I placed, the pump would turn on to pump water.
The MAIN goal was to water a plant by measuring the moisture of the soil and thus watering when needed and having the results posted on a grpah in MATLAB.
